I am a PhD student currently doing research in Variational Inequalities. My favorite subject, and the primary tool used in my research is Mathematical Analysis. On this page I post problem sets that I make that are designed to supplement a course being taken in a specific area of analysis. The main objectives of these problem sets is to help students gets exposure to the often implicit details of common proofs and arguemnts in this subject, and to help students transition from the undergraduate level to the graduate level in analysis, a transition I am still trying to make myself. If any errors are found, either typos or in the correctness of a solution, please let me know at jfranks4@gmu.edu. While many solutions are my own, many are from various other sources that I encountered or used in my personal study, and I in no way intened to use someone else's work without credit. All credit for such solutions goes to the original authors.
